## üìò Documentation

Documentation is still a work in progress. Between the [Devflow Docs](https://docs.getdevflow.com/), [Qubus Components](https://docs.qubusphp.com/) documentation,
and [CodefyPHP's](https://codefyphp.com/documentation/) documentation, that should help you get started.

## üôå Sponsors

## üñã Contributing

Devflow could always be better! If you are interested in contributing enhancements or bug fixes, here are a few
rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before I accept and merge your work.
- You MUST follow the [QubusPHP Coding Standards](https://github.com/QubusPHP/qubus-coding-standard) and PSR-12.
- You MUST write (or update) unit tests.
- You SHOULD write documentation.
- Please, write [commit messages that make sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
  and rebase your branch before submitting your Pull Request.
- Please [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) too.
  This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (I don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`,
  etc.).
